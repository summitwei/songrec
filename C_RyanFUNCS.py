    """
    Defines a local neighborhood and finds the local peaks
    in the spectrogram, which must be larger than the
    specified `amp_min`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    log_spectrogram : numpy.ndarray, shape=(n_freq, n_time)
        Log-scaled spectrogram. Columns are the periodograms of
        successive segments of a frequency-time spectrum.

    amp_min : float
        Amplitude threshold applied to local maxima

    p_nn : int
        Number of cells around an amplitude peak in the spectrogram in order

    Returns
    -------
    List[Tuple[int, int]]
        Time and frequency index-values of the local peaks in spectrogram.
        Sorted by ascending frequency and then time.

    Notes
    -----
    The local peaks are returned in column-major order for the spectrogram.
    That is, the peaks are ordered by time. That is, we look for nearest
    neighbors of increasing frequencies at the same times, and then move to
    the next time bin.
